Joe was sitting in Chipotle eating a burrito bowl when the weirdest thing happened. He got a call from his roommate who told him to go look outside. 

He looked out the window and saw his roomate with the largest parade float he had ever seen. He asked "what is that?", his roomate simply replyed "come outside and find out".
